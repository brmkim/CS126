Summary     : Conversion between character sets and surfaces
Description :
Made for CS126
The `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.
It recognises or produces nearly 150 different character sets
and is able to transliterate files between almost any pair. When exact
transliteration are not possible, it may get rid of the offending
characters or fall back on approximations.  Most RFC 1345 character sets
are supported.
